# DontMoveAndLook
 Interactive, surround AV instalation.

 Sound: 
 
 - It uses a scalable surround sound by default is set up for a 9.0 surround sound.

 - I used two sound sources, the first one is an audio generative sound synthesis, following the just intonation tuning giving a more etheral sound. The second sound source comes from a live microphone capturing and playing back on site sound for a distant area.

 - By using a webcam and capturing the movement in front of the camera, I'm able to glitch and alterate the sound in real time from the live microphone.


 Video:

 - The video is transmited in real time from a differnet location and displayed to the audience, on the same site that the microphone is placed.

 - A webcam captures de movement of the audience and it triggers a glitch algorithm, giving a sensation of disorientation and as soon as there is no movement pick up by the webcam, the video stabilizes and keeps displaying the transmition.
